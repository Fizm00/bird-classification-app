# Bird Classification App 🦉

Welcome to the **Bird Classification App**! This app uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to identify bird species from uploaded images. With a friendly Streamlit interface, users can explore bird classification powered by deep learning and computer vision. 🐦📸

## ✨ Features

- 🖼️ **Image Upload**: Easily upload an image of a bird for classification.
- ⚡ **Real-Time Predictions**: Get instant predictions with confidence scores.
- 🎨 **User-Friendly Interface**: Navigate through a smooth, responsive UI built with Streamlit.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Streamlit
- TensorFlow

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/bird-classification-app.git
   cd bird-classification-app
2. **Create a virtual environment (recommended)**
   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `env\Scripts\activate`
3. Install dependencies
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Run the App
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py

## 🐥 Usage

1. Upload an Image: Select or drag a bird image file to the upload section.
2. View the Prediction: The app will display the predicted species and confidence score.
