    Welcome to the Bird Classification App! üê¶

    This application uses a trained deep learning model to classify different species of birds based on the images you upload. 
    Simply select an image of a bird from your device, and click the **Process** button to see the classification result.

    ### Instructions:
    1. Click on the **Choose an image...** button to upload a bird image.
    2. After uploading, click on **Process** to analyze the image.
    3. The app will display the predicted bird species along with the confidence level.

    We hope you enjoy using this application!
